## aMetro

There's [aMetro](http://www.ametro.org), which creates an
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ametro).
Their map data comes from pMetro, see below.
Their [license page](http://www.ametro.org/license) states that aMetro
itself is published under the terms of the GPL and the source code is
available on the [Github page](https://github.com/RomanGolovanov/ametro).
It also states that the maps are distributed by pMetro for non-commercial
use only.

## pMetro

The [pMetro](http://pmetro.su) project provides a map file and editor.
Software seems to be Windows only and not open source. The website is in
russian only. Map data appears to be outdated and map data sources indicate
that the maps are not free.
