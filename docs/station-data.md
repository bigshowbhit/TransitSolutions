# Station Data File Format

Stuff we want to support:
* stairs, escalators, elevators going somewhere from the tracks
  (i.e. to street level, shopping malls or intermediate levels)
* shops, vending machines, etc. available on the platforms
* information on how to get from one line to another at stations with
  multiple lines
* support information about intermediate levels
